Well, I have so many things to say, but one thing is for sure, that I'm in love with XState library.
When I was studing for the university there was a fundamental subject called `Digital Logic Design`.
Digital Logic Design is a area of study in electrical engineering and computer science that deals with the design and analysis of digital circuits, like binary systems, logic gates, boolean Algebra, sequential Logic etc.

When I first started working as software engineer, I was finding lots of similarities between software logic and digital logic that could apply to my codebase. After a little digging, I realised that also `Uncle Bob` had so much to say about it. This is a very interesting article you can reach out [Pickled State](https://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2018/06/06/PickledState.html).

Then, I found out Xstate library and the amazing work of Stately in creating statecharts easily. Breafly,
XState is a state management and orchestration solution for JavaScript and TypeScript apps. You could find more to the official site [XState](https://stately.ai/docs/xstate).


Lots of solutions I have given to more complex problems related with complex forms, payment process and paraller proceduces, 
was due to Xstate.

It doesn't matter if its React, Java or C#, but it's all about the mindset of desiging a solution based on states and actions that make it more interesting!
